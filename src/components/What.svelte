		<p>A short story... enjoy 😉</p>
		<p>TLDR; A project borne out of idleness</p>
		<p>
			Alright, one time - at work - during one sprint planning session like that, everyone were
			picking what they're to do in the sprint that's just about to start; then it got to my turn to
			choose tasks then my manager said NO 🙁
		</p>
		<p>
			He asked that I go on holiday but lurk around to give support to other engineers. I don't know
			why - probably, trying to help me spend more time with my sweetheart. But I love work, I want
			to build amazing things.
		</p>
		<p>
			Anyways, I resolved to toying with css transitioning and svelte using my sweetheart's name 😜
			and this was birthed. 🥂
